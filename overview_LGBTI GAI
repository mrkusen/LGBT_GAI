Global Acceptance Index

Social attitudes can heavily influence whether LGBT people are accepted or rejected by employers, family members, teachers, clergy, and society as a whole. The Global Acceptance Index (GAI) uses data from more than 2,750 surveys conducted over 30 years to measure changing levels of acceptance toward LGBT people and issues in 175 countries. The GAI provides each nation with a score of 0 to 10 to indicate their level of acceptance.
